## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Header.tsx
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
